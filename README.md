Adapt &amp; FineTune LLM for Critic Thought

Same principle of [LLaMA-Adapter](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/LLaMA-Adapter) but for output "adapter" and multiple llm model (llava). 

**LLM-OutAdapter** is based on [MPT-7B](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b) and is chosen to handle extremely long inputs (ALiBi).

  - Model type: Causal decoder with evaluation output;
  - Language(s) (NLP) : English and French;
